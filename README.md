This branch deals with using [PyMC3](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) for inference of a Hellings-Downs type problem


It works medium-well (try `run.py`) but not perfectly. 

Specifically, for a few parameters, e.g. $\Omega$ and $\Phi_0$, works no problem.

For $\theta_{\rm gw}$ I could never get it to converge nicely.
