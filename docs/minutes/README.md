## Minutes of meetings


This file is a record of discussions, interesting points and suggestions from group meetings around this PTA project


### 20/04


* Is the $\Phi_0$ term correct in the measurement equation? Are all the pulsars really in phase at this time?

* Can we reformulate in terms of phase rather than frequency to make contact with observations better?

* Try for more physical (i.e. smaller!) GW strains

* What is going on with $\iota$? Can we infer this parameter? Try a reparameterisation in terms of h_+ and h_\{times}

* Be clear on how single source PTA analyses are currently done 

* Include the pulsar parameters $d$ and $\sigma_p$ in the inference
    * Use a smaller PTA $\sim$ 20 pulsars
    * Inference on all GW parameters + all pulsar distances
    * Inference on all GW parameters + all $\sigma_p$.

* What are reasonable, astrophysical values for $\sigma_p$ and $\gamma$
